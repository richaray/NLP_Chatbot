A conversational AI chatbot powered by PyTorch and Flask, designed to transition from a terminal-based interface to a dynamic web application. The chatbot leverages a trained neural network model to process user input and deliver intelligent responses based on predefined intents.

Features:

AI-driven Chatbot: Uses a custom-trained neural network with PyTorch for accurate and context-aware responses.

Web Interface: Flask-based frontend for seamless user interaction via a modern web browser.

Dynamic Conversations: Processes user input in real-time, returning responses with over 75% confidence.

Customizable Intents: Easily modify or expand the chatbot's intents by editing the intents.json file.

Scalable Codebase: Modular design with separate files for model training, response handling, and application logic.

Technologies Used:
Python (Flask, PyTorch)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
JSON for defining intents and patterns
